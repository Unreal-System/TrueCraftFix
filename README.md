# TrueCraftFix
Just Fix Biuld TrueCraft in Windows.

Please download and decompression file.

See readme.txt

!!Warning!!
At least it works fine on my computer.

But it does have a lot of problems.

The following questions may appear randomly.

1.Block cannot continue to load.

2.Can't pick up any items.

3.Can't to destroy any blocks.

4.Can't open backpack.

Wait a series of questions....

I hope that everyone can rewrite it to let more people understand the programming techniques that this game can provide.

I am an unqualified Programmer.....I can't know how to use git...○|￣|_

Maybe because the program I write is often linear...This is very unfriendly to open source....

I don't know if anyone in the community can lead to rewrite it, but I have a lot of time.
